# rob535-perception-project
Fall 2019 Final project for ROB535: Self Driving Cars. This is the perception part.

## Setup
Install required dependencies by:
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rob535-fall-2019-task-1-image-classification/data). Alternatively, set up API token and use below command:
```bash
$ kaggle competitions download -c rob535-fall-2019-task-1-image-classification
```
Unzip the downloaded data into the `data/` directory as follows:
```
data
├── rob535-fall-2019-task-1-image-classification
```
We pretrained a model based on ResNeXt-50 and uploaded to google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-63b76I54aiyGQl5ZR_7Qkjm3RT-HpfN/view?usp=sharing). Before running the test code, download this model and place it in the `models/` directory:
```
models
└── team10_trained_resnext_epoch5.pt
```
## Task 1
The following command will use the pretrained model to evaluate the data. It will output a new file called `predictions.csv`. Warning: If on CPU, this will take a few minutes (~6 minutes):
```bash
$ python task1.py
```
To submit to Kaggle for evaluation:
```bash
kaggle competitions submit -c rob535-fall-2019-task-1-image-classification -f predictions.csv -m "new submission"
```

## Task 2
Optional for 20 bonus points. We did not try it yet.

## Additional information
The model was trained on a Tesla K80 GPU provided by Google Colab. Refer to `colab/transfer_learning.ipynb` for details. The final trained model is stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-63b76I54aiyGQl5ZR_7Qkjm3RT-HpfN/view?usp=sharing).
